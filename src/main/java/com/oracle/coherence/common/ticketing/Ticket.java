/**
 * <p>A {@link Ticket} is an specialized {@link Identifier} that represents a
 * ordered "sequence number" issued by an ordered "issuer".  That is, 
 * {@link Ticket}s are comparable and thus have a natural order.</p>
 *
 * <p>Internally {@link Ticket}s are represented by two "longs".  The first
 * "long" is used to identify the "issuer".  The second "long" is used to identify
 * the "sequence number" of the {@link Ticket} issued by the "issuer".</p>
 *
 * <p>As "issuers" are represented as longs, "issuers" are comparable.  Thus
 * {@link Ticket}s issued by issuer 0 will occur (be ordered) before 
 * {@link Ticket}s issued by issuer 1 etc.</p>
 * 
 * <p>A useful way to represent a range of {@link Ticket}s issued by a single 
 * "issuer" is to use a {@link TicketBook}.</p>
