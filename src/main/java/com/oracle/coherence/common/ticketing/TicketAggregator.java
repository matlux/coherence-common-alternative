/**
 * <p>The {@link TicketAggregator} is a parallel {@link AbstractAggregator} that
 * produces an ordered {@link LinkedList} of {@link TicketBook}s (based on natural ordering
 * of {@link TicketBook}s).  Each {@link TicketBook} optimally represents an ordered 
 * range of {@link Ticket}s that have been aggregated for each "issuer".</p>
 * 
 * <p>This aggregator is useful for constructing ranges of {@link Ticket}s from across
 * a cluster.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This aggregator has two passes.  The first pass (non-final) collects all of the {@link Ticket}s
 * for each "issuer" to produce a set of {@link TicketBook}s.  The second pass (final)
 * combines the {@link TicketBook}s and produces a {@link LinkedList} of {@link TicketBook}s,
 * representing all of the {@link Ticket}s that have been aggregated.</p>
 * 
 * <p>When using this aggregator constructor, you must specify either the name of the method 
 * that returns a {@link Ticket} OR a {@link ValueExtractor} that produces a {@link Ticket}
 * to be aggregated.</p>
