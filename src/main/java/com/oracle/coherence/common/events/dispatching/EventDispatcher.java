/**
 * <p>An {@link EventDispatcher} is responsible dispatching {@link Event}s to {@link EventProcessor}s for processing.</p>
 * 
 * <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> In general, {@link Event} dispatching and processing of said {@link Event}s via an 
 * {@link EventDispatcher} always occurs on the thread that requested the dispatch.  This means that should a 
 * Coherence owned thread request an {@link Event} to be dispatched and thus processed, said processing will occur
 * using/on the Coherence owned thread (unless the {@link EventProcessor} is asynchronous or {@link #dispatchEventLater(Event)}
 * was used for dispatching).</p>
 * 
 * <p>In such situations, where a Coherence owned thread performs the dispatching and thus execution of 
 * {@link EventProcessor}s, care should be taken to ensure said {@link EventProcessor}s don't make re-entrant calls onto
 * Coherence APIs, specifically onto the same Coherence Service that owns the said thread.  This typically means
 * avoiding calls to CacheFactory.getCache(...) for caches managed by the said serivce thread.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Should an {@link EventProcessor} require access to a cache, and it can't be guaranteed that is safe to do so, the
 * {@link EventProcessor} should be made "asynchronous".</p>
