/**
 * <p>A {@link LifecycleAwareEntry} is a cache {@link java.util.Map.Entry} that is capable of handling
 * {@link com.oracle.coherence.common.events.Event}s that occur on itself.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Essentially a {@link LifecycleAwareEntry} is a specialized {@link EventProcessor},
 * specifically for {@link EntryEvent}s.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Unlike the original LifecycleAwareCacheEntry class from Coherence Common 1.5 which where based on 
 * {@link com.tangosol.util.MapEvent}s, {@link LifecycleAwareEntry}s are based on the new {@link EntryEvent}
 * interfaces/classes.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Note however, like Coherence Common 1.5, processing of the {@link com.oracle.coherence.common.events.Event} occurs on the thread that raised
 * the said {@link com.oracle.coherence.common.events.Event} and as such care should be taken it the {@link com.oracle.coherence.common.events.Event} was raised by a Coherence owned 
 * Service/Worker thread.  If there is any doubt as to the thread-safety of calls made by the 
 * {@link EventProcessor#process(com.oracle.coherence.common.events.dispatching.EventDispatcher, Event)} method, 
 * the said method should use an alternate thread for execution.</p>
 * 
 * <p><strong>Advice:</strong> It's generally recommended that you implement the {@link EventProcessor}
 * interface instead of this interface as it's possibly clearer for the reader of your Entry/Value object.</p>
