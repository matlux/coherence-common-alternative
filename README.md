# coherence-common - An alternative

This is a fork of Oracle Coherence's coherence-common version 2.1.2.31472 which is part of The Coherence Incubator (Release 10). See  http://coherence.oracle.com/display/INC10/coherence-common for more details. This repository is not endorsed by Oracle. It is only a way for users of Coherence to experiment and extend the work done by Oracle to suggest possible evolutions of the Incubator base code.

## Install

## Added feature:
